// placeholder file for main app functionality page

/*

  main functionality page

  two main columns:
  left column (larger) will be items
  right column (much smaller) will be users

  drag and drop users into items, items will split automatically based on the amount of users that exist on that item

  notes:
  lock items to reduce visual clutter? <-- move to a separate tab that is collapsable

  where to put tax and tip options?

  full summary page to see how much each person owes and a way to indicate who paid maybe

  code to join room? lock maneuverability of users to user and room creator?
